\maketitle

List of topics from \cite{MR1469358} we'll cover:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Definitions (signed graphs, signed degree, signed degree sequences, standard form of signed degree sequences), along with some examples.
    \item Previous results (Lemma 1, Theorem 2).
    \item Theorem 3 with proof, theorem 7 without proof.
    \item Theorems 9 and 10, with an idea of proof given.
    \item Maybe some further questions we have at the end.
\end{enumerate}

For visuals, we'll mostly just be showing drawings of signed graphs as examples for the definitions, with things like signed degree labelled.
