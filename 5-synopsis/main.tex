\textbf{Talk title:} Signed degree sequences of signed graphs

In MATH 443 we covered the characteristics which make a sequence of nonnegative
numbers ``graphical,'' (corresponding to the degree sequence of a graph). We
also discussed the Havel-Hakimi algorithm for constructing graphs from a given
degree sequence. But what if we extended the concept of degree to the positive
and negative integers? We present results from Jing-Ho Yan, Ko-Wei Lih, David
Kuo, and Gerard. G Chang which characterize the signed degree sequences of
graphs with signed edges, as well as a polynomial-time algorithm to construct a
signed graph given a signed degree sequence. We also present their
characterizations of signed trees and multigraphs.
